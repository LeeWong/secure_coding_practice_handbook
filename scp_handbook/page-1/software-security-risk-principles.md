# Software Security Risk Principles

## Overview

The goal of software security is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information resources in order to enable successful business operations. This goal is accomplished through the implementation of security controls where risk assessment provides insight for the implementation of security controls.

Software security risk is a combination of factors that threaten the success of the business. It can be described conceptually as follow: a threat agent interacts with a system, which may have a vulnerability that can be exploited in order to cause an impact. An impact is the magnitude of harm that can be expected to result from the consequences of unauthorized disclosure of information, unauthorized modification of information, unauthorized destruction of information, or loss of information or information system availability.

Risk assessment such as threat modeling helps the engineering team identify, assess, and implement key security controls to mitigate risks in applications. Information risk classification provides guidance for risk assessment.
